    <ol>
      <li><b>Unidirectional relationship: </b> In this relationship, only one entity can refer the properties to another. It contains only one owing side that specifies how an update can be made in the database.</li>
      <li><b>Bidirectional relationship: </b>This relationship contains an owning side as well as an inverse side. So here every entity has a relationship field or refer the property to other entity.</li>
